# Statistical-Inference
## OVERVIEW
This is the part 1 of the final project from Courseraâ€™s statistical inference course. In this project we investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution is simulated using the R function rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter which is set to 0.2 and n is the number of exponential used in each sample distribution, which is set to 40. The theoretical mean of population distribution is calculated using the formula 1/lambda and the theoretical standard deviation is given as 1/lambda. A thousand simulations is used to estimate population distribution.
